# Introduction

This is a server programmed in JS, made to possibly be used in data servers that have login authentication protocols set in place, through which a client could access a NAS (Network) from the local network. 
I expect to be able to develop an API that could access some text files, such as Excel or Word files. 

# Necessary steps

I hope to be able to turn this into a *npm* package.
